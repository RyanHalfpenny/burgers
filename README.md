I've completed coding out the burger app. 

I ran into multiple roadblock that seems to be stopping my deployment. 
  1. My heroku jawsDB isn't hooking so my link is broken. 
  2. MYsql schema isn't running correctly when i run "mysql -u root -p"
  
 I've included screenshot of my mySQL terminal error and heroku error. 
 
 I won't be able to deploy a functional application but I wanted to subit the work i did.
